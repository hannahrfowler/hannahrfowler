## Hi there 👋🏽

### 🙋🏽‍♀️ I'm Hannah Fowler.

I recently graduated with a double major in Computer Science and Musical Studies with a minor in African American Music.

😄 Pronouns: (she/her)

⚡ Fun fact: I took an immersive trip to The Gambia and Senegal, where I studied West African drumming and dance for two weeks.


## Currently I'm working on... 🕹️

🔭 I’m currently working on a web game built only with HTML, CSS, and Vanilla Javascript.

🌱 I’m currently improving my skills as a full-stack web developer.

🤔 I’m looking for help with building out my GitHub.
