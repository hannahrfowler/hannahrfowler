## Hi there 👋🏽

### 🙋🏽‍♀️ I'm Hannah Fowler.

I recently graduated with a double major in Computer Science and Musical Studies with a minor in African American Music.

😄 Pronouns: (she/her)

👩🏽‍💻 Software Engineer at [SmartWiz](https://smartwiz.io/)

⚡ Fun fact: I took an immersive trip to The Gambia and Senegal, where I studied West African drumming and dance for two weeks.

🌱 I’m currently learning AWS and the Botpress API.

🤔 I’m looking for help with building out my GitHub.
